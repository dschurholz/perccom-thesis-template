# PERCCOM Thesis Template

### A Latex template for the PERCCOM Thesis format 2019.

Add your own variables for the cover and abstract pages in `thesis/constants.tex`.

The document is built from `thesis/main.tex`.

The order of documents is:

    thesis/nimio.tex
    thesis/abstract.tex
    thesis/introduction.tex
    thesis/thesis.tex
    thesis/results.tex
    thesis/conclusions.tex

Change the order, titles and names on any respective file. Also add more chapters if you have, and don't forget to add them on the `thesis/main.tex` file.

The references are listed in the `thesis/ref.bib` file.

This template is a modified version of the LUT Dissertation unoficial template found in [https://www.lut.fi/web/en/library/dissertations1](https://www.lut.fi/web/en/library/dissertations1)
