\section{RESULTS}\label{sec:results}
\par Depending on the type of the work then results are presented in a separate section. Sometimes the arrangements for the experiments are also described in this section. And in some cases the section contains also some consideration of the quality of the results, even some discussion and conclusions. It might be reasonable to divide section ``Results'' into several, e.g. ``Experiments'' and ``Results''. Discuss these options with your supervisor.  The thesis also contains some discussion about the future work.
 
\par Define the structure of the thesis according to your requirements. Discuss the structure with you supervisor(s). There can be subsections in each section, and also sub-subsections if needed. Keep in mind that the thesis is an independent presentation of the work done. The presentation is also consistent and logical, everything is carefully considered and presented.
